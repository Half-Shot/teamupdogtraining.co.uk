{{#>section heading="About Us"}}
Team Up Dog Training aims to help owners and handlers learn to work together with their dogs, building a bond and understanding of each other that results in a happy and obedient dog.
We use positive training methods, and believe that the best results for all are achieved when the dog willingly wants to please the handler.

  <strong>Jill</strong> has been training seriously for over 20 years.  She says "some of my dogs have been rather challenging, reactive, but ultimately extremely rewarding.
  Thank you to my challenging boys, you are the ones who taught me the most!
  Every dog, and every owner, are different, and I find it incredibly rewarding trying to help find what makes each individual pair tick."
